# Retrieval Augmented Generation

## Motivation

I created [Passage Probe](https://github.com/tdeshazo/passage-probe) as part of the 2025 Boot.dev Hackathon. Realizing I need to drill down on some of the concepts, I am taking [Boot.dev's Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-retrieval-augmented-generation) course.

## Roadmap

- [x] Implement query, datasource preprocessing
- [x] Create an `InvertedIndex` class
- [x] Save and load cache search index
- [x] Wire index into search
- [ ] Boolean search functions
- [ ] TF-IDF
- [ ] BM25
- [ ] Embeddings
- [ ] Chunking
- [ ] RRF
